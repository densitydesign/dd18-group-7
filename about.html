            <p>
              This project was created during the DensityDesign Final Synthesis
              Design Studio course of the Master's Degree in Communication
              Design at the Polytechnic University of Milan.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is based upon a research activity carried out during the same
              course, which revolved around the relationship between the issue
              of greenwashing and the automotive sector, for which a printed
              report was made. Considering how broad these two subjects are, the
              analysis focused on analysing possible different strategies
              present inside of adverts published by car brands on YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
              The aim of this archive is thus to re-organise these adverts
              depending on what communication strategies they appear to include
              inside, both in a de-contextualised and in a contextualised
              manner.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, these strategies could be interpreted as both “subtle”
              greenwashing and as typical advertising efforts, and since they're
              often mixed together, they're hard to recognise and categorise.
              Thus, they could be leveraged by car brands not to just persuade
              people into buying a new model, but also to promote a cleaner
              image of themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, car owners, potential customers or—more
              simply—individuals interested in subjects like mobility or energy
              transition can examine this content with a critical perspective,
              reflect on, or just form their opinion on it.

                How did we select the adverts?
              </h1>
            </div>
            <p>
              To make a well-balanced study across different propulsion types,
              we analysed the adverts published before the end of the second
              financial quarter of 2021 of 30 petrol (a.k.a. internal combustion
              engine or ICE), 30 hybrid (a.k.a. hybrid electric or HE) and 30
              electric (a.k.a. battery electric or BE) models—for a total of 90
              different vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The models were selected starting from a ranking of all the ones
              sold in Europe in 2021 by number of sales, published in an article
              written by Demandt (n.d.).
            </p>
            <p>
              To have a comparable set of advertisements from the get-go, we
              considered only the brands that had a global or a European channel
              on YouTube at the time. Not only that, we decided to limit the
              adverts to just passenger vehicles (therefore no big vans like the
              Ford Transit were included). To make up for the limited number of
              adverts, and include as many brands as possible, we followed these
              two arbitrary rules:
            </p>
            <p>
              Limit the number of petrol and hybrid models to a maximum of three
              for each brand
            </p>
            <p>
              Limit the number of electric vehicles to a maximum of two for each
              brand
            </p>
            <p>
              So, we went through the ranking from the top and checked
              iteratively what kinds of engines were available at the time for
              each vehicle; then, for each version, we checked whether there
              were any adverts available on one of the global/European channels.
              This made it possible to include multiple versions of the same
              models, and at the same time exclude content that followed other
              kinds of formats (like vlogs or premieres).

              After having defined a list of comparable videos, we analysed them
              one by one, and compiled a storyboard for each one of them.
              Therefore, we approached them with a qualitative but standardised
              method: for each sequence, we described the visual, audio and
              textual content and compared them. Thus, we clustered them by
              similarity and gave each resulting cluster an identification name.
              This way, we listed them by how many times they appeared and
              selected just the ones that were relevant with the subject of
              sustainability or greenwashing. Finally, some specific properties
              for each strategy were defined, starting from their descriptions,
              which are listed below.

              could be viewed as a place that could be updated with more adverts
              and possible new strategies in the future.S
